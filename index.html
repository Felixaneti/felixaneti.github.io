				<h2>Web Design</h2>
				<p>
					The best web design software will make it simple to build the website you need, either by using a drag-and-drop editor where you can combine different elements easily without coding, or else a software platform that involves customizing web code such as HTML &amp; CSS and even JavaScript for your own needs. As with any great endeavor, web design is about both inspiration and perseverance. Back in the day, creating web pages was the sole province of hardcore coders, but thatâ€™s not the case anymore given that there are numerous tools to simplify the process. Some of these even have a visual interface like a website builder, allowing you to drag and drop links, text and images as if you were designing a poster or presentation. Other web design tools are geared towards programmers, acting as advanced text editors, and allowing for building a website line-by-line.
